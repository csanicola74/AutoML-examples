## Experiment #1
1. Focus on classification (binary or multi-class outcome variable)
    - Sex
    - Exercised Induced Angina
    - Chest Pain Type
    - Resting EKG Results
    - Fasting Blood Sugar
2. The variable tested was **Chest Pain Type**
3. Per AutoML, the best model was the **Decision Tree**
    - **Metric details**
    - 0	1	2	3	accuracy	macro avg	weighted avg	logloss
    - precision	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	3e-06
    - recall	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	3e-06
    - f1-score	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	3e-06
    - support	28	10	16	5	1	59	59	3e-06

4. Compared to Baseline, the model performed _worse_

## Experiment #2
1. Focus on regression (continuous outcome variable)
    - Age
    - Maximum Heart Rate Achieved
    - Resting Blood Pressure
    - Cholesterol
2. The variable tested was **Cholesterol**
3. Per AutoML, the best model was the **Ensemble**
    - **Metric Score**
    - MAE	29.6805
    - MSE	1351.29
    - RMSE	36.7598
    - R2	0.156103
    - MAPE	0.130562

4. Compared to Baseline, the model performed _worse_
