## Experiment #1
- Test for 
3. Create two 'experiments' using the autoML package mljar-supervised 
One that is focused around classification (binary or multi-class outcome variable)
One that is focused around regression (continuous outcome variable) 
4. Include the output of the mljar-supervised output folder inside of the github repo (e.g., so there should be 2 folders - one for classification and one for regression) 

5. In a markdown file (readme.md): 
    - Describe the two dependent variables (outcomes) for experiment 1 and experiment 2 
    - Describe for each experiment: 
        - What was the best performing model (please interpret (a) log-loss or RMSE between models, and (b) AUC) 
        - How much better (? if any) did the model perform compared to baseline
