## Experiment #1
1. Focus on classification (binary or multi-class outcome variable)
    - Sex
    - Exercised Induced Angina
    - Chest Pain Type
    - Resting EKG Results
    - Fasting Blood Sugar
2. The variable tested was **Chest Pain Type**
3. Per AutoML, the best model was the **Decision Tree**
    - log-loss:
    - AUC:
4. Compared to Baseline, the model performed _(better/worse)_

## Experiment #2
1. Focus on regression (continuous outcome variable)
    - Age
    - Maximum Heart Rate Achieved
    - Resting Blood Pressure
    - Cholesterol
2. The variable tested was **Cholesterol**
3. Per AutoML, the best model was the **Ensemble**
